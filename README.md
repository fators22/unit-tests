# Overview

This is a maven project with unit tests written for implementation with GitHub Classroom autograding.  Process of creating this repo was for the [csa-teacher-help](https://github.com/csa-teachers-help) organization.  It should be noted that the unit test written for this repo are not complete and I would recommend adding more unit tests.  To do that you could fork this project or use the template to create your own version.

To setup this specific project to run with GitHub Classroom Autograding you can use this repo as the starter code when creating the assignment and then on the Autograding section you can add a test.  If you have forked or created your own version of this project then you should definitely be using that as the starter code instead.

You should select "Run Java" as the test type.  The setup command is `mvn compile` and then run command is `mvn test`.  Change timeout down to 3-5 minutes.
